# 🚀 DSA Journey – From Easy ➝ Medium ➝ Hard  

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey of solving Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems** on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  

👉 The goal: **Start with Easy problems**, build a strong foundation, then move on to **Medium**, and finally tackle **Hard** problems.  

I’m solving problems **in order (progressively)**, not separating them into different folders for difficulty. Each solution is written in **JavaScript (ES6+)**.
